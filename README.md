Comparative illustration of heatmaps generated by our proposed and the best baseline of root scheme (DTD-Z+) over ImageNet. As seen, the advantages achieved by our proposed can be highlighted as: (i) more accurate explanations with less noise; (ii) stronger hierarchical representation, where different regions of the target object have different colors, reflecting that the weights assigned by the proposed are closer to optimal; (iii) reflection of object contours and even textures. The visualizations utilize the Turbo colormap to highlight details and ensure color (\emph{i.e.} relevance) accessibility for colorblind readers, and mean cropping is applied to enhance the contrast.
